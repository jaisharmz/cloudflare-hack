            "Not only mathematicians are interested by unsolved problems and conjectures but also a high number of students of all fields who are eager to explore the depth of mathematics. Also, many mathematics problems are related to some problems of logic which we encounter in our daily life and this makes even people who are not scientists very interested by the meanings of the unsolved conjectures and by the possibilities of the solution. This short article about the Collatz conjecture uses easy mathematical tools and represents a fruit of my interest regarding the problems and riddles which mathematicians find complicated. I hope that other researchers can use the results of this article as a collaboration to solve this famous problem. The students may also find in this work an easy introduction to the meanings of the Collatz conjecture.\n",

            "The Collatz or 3x + 1 conjecture is perhaps the simplest stated yet unsolved problem in mathematics in the last 70 years. It was circulated orally by Lothar Collatz at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Cambridge, Mass, in 1950 (Lagarias, 2010). The problem is known as the Thwaites conjecture (after Sir Bryan Thwaites), Hasse's algorithm (after Helmut Hasse), or the Syracuse problem. In this concise paper I provide a proof of this conjecture, by finding an upper bound to the Collatz sequence and, as a consequence, a contradiction.\n",

            "Collatz conjecture states that : start with any positive integer n. If the integer is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. If the number is even, keep on dividing it by 2 until an odd integer is obtained. After repeating this sequence again and again, one will be obtained as the final result. It is also known as the 3n+1 problem or the Ulam conjecture. This paper presents the proof of the collatz conjecture using the basic concepts of number theory.\n",

            "This is a mathematical letter that uses easy tools in order to prove some interesting results about the Collatz conjecture. This short article carries on the efforts of the previous article about the Collatz conjecture which proves easily an interesting useful sequence with some other results by following a logical method. This work demonstrates also an interesting result which is the five only expressions of the numbers which respect the Collatz conjecture. This result may simplify many other demonstrations regarding the Collatz conjecture. Hence, I invite the readers to discover this content in order to make a new step towards the proof of this beautiful useful conjecture.\n",

            "final version of this paper here -> https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351347153 In this paper, we prove the Collatz conjecture. We show that if a given number can be represented in a form of a certain specific equation then Collatz conjecture is true for that particular number. Next we propose a procedure that for a given number produces this specific equation and we prove that for every initial positive integer, such equation can be found.\n",

            "We here provide a proof of the Collatz conjecture, also known as the (3x+1) or Syracuse conjecture. The proof is organised as follows. First, three distinct fixed points are found for the third iterate of the Collatz map, which hence organise in a period 3 orbit of the original map. These are 1, 2 and 4, the elements which define the unique attracting cycle, as hypothesised by Collatz. To carry out the calculation we write the positive integers in modulo 8, obtain a closed analytical form for the associated map and determine the transitions that yield contracting or expanding iterates. Then, in the second part of the proof, we consider a probabilistic analogue of the deterministic map, where the period-3 orbit {1, 2, 4} acts as an absorbing sink. Working in this setting, we demonstrate that the quasi-stationary state sampled by the system while seeking for its deputed equilibrium is contracting and that each trajectory is bound to converge to the fixed points, as identified above. This implies in turn that all positive integer numbers converge to the period–3 orbit formed by the numbers {1, 2, 4}, under repeated application of the Collatz map. This proves in turn the conjecture.\n",

            "In this paper, we investigate the possible scenarios in which a number does not satisfy the Collatz Conjecture, or the 3x+1 conjecture. Specifically, we examine the algebraic behavior of possible counterexamples of the Collatz Conjecture which may lead to a loop other than the trivial loop or unbounded divergence. In order to investigate these, we examine the parity of the numbers in a general Collatz reduction sequence. Further, we examine cases in which these parity cycles are infinitely periodic with finite period. Through the research conducted in the paper, we formulate a necessary algebraic condition for looping in the Collatz Conjecture. We also prove that if a number has a diverging reduction sequence, then it must generate an infinite aperiodic parity cycle.\n",

Also, many mathematics problems are related to some problems of logic which we encounter in our daily life and this makes even people who are not scientists very interested by the meanings of the unsolved conjectures and by the possibilities of the solution. This short article about the Collatz conjecture uses easy mathematical tools and represents a fruit of my interest regarding the problems and riddles which mathematicians find complicated. I hope that other researchers can use the results of this article as a collaboration to solve this famous problem.

It was circulated orally by Lothar Collatz at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Cambridge, Mass, in 1950 (Lagarias, 2010). The problem is known as the Thwaites conjecture (after Sir Bryan Thwaites), Hasse's algorithm (after Helmut Hasse), or the Syracuse problem. In this concise paper I provide a proof of this conjecture, by finding an upper bound to the Collatz sequence and, as a consequence, a contradiction.\n",

Next we propose a procedure that for a given number produces this specific equation and we prove that for every initial positive integer, such equation can be found.\n",

            "We here provide a proof of the Collatz conjecture, also known as the (3x+1) or Syracuse conjecture. The proof is organised as follows. First, three distinct fixed points are found for the third iterate of the Collatz map, which hence organise in a period 3 orbit of the original map. These are 1, 2 and 4, the elements which define the unique attracting cycle, as hypothesised by Collatz. To carry out the calculation we write the positive integers in modulo 8, obtain a closed analytical form for the associated map and determine the transitions that yield contracting or expanding iterates. Then, in the second part of the proof, we consider a probabilistic analogue of the deterministic map, where the period-3 orbit {1, 2, 4} acts as an absorbing sink. Working in this setting, we demonstrate that the quasi-stationary state sampled by the system while seeking for its deputed equilibrium is contracting and that each trajectory is bound to converge to the fixed points, as identified above. This implies in turn that all positive integer numbers converge to the period–3 orbit formed by the numbers {1, 2, 4}, under repeated application of the Collatz map. This proves in turn the conjecture.\n",
