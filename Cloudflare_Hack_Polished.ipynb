            "So Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and former chief scientist of OpenAI, started a new company a week ago focused on developing superintelligence. I generally don't like to question motives and rather focus on claims and arguments, but I'm beginning to have more sympathy for people who question whether people at big tech companies really believe in the safety objectives of their companies like they claim they do. Sutskever seems to be known as \"the safety guy\" when he also seems to be the one that is most aggressive in developing superintelligence – the very thing that could destroy the world. This ideology is very hard to grasp. \n",
            "Keep in mind that this doesn't in any way dispute that very capable AI systems could pose highly extreme risks to society. If the interests of those who are developing these technologies in the first place are questionable, we should focus more on the arguments made by other relevant stakeholders like academics, civil society members, researchers at think-tanks, etc. There are a lot of people who provide reasonable arguments for why certain kinds of AI systems could pose very extreme risks, perhaps even an extinction risk. \n",
            "It is theoretically very hard to understand how societies can develop superintelligence, defined as an AI system far surpassing human abilities in every domain, and make it safe. Even if such a superintelligence was completely docile (a big assumption), how could it be ensured that it wouldn’t be used for malicious purposes or have unintended consequences even when used for the right goals? \n",
            "I wrote in an essay a year ago about three lines of defence to reduce AI risks at a societal level, and one of the strongest defences is not to develop the AI model in the first place. Or when expanded to this context: never to develop superintelligence in the first place. If we cannot ensure that it’s under control of humans and that it isn’t used for negative unintended consequences, then the right approach is not to develop it at all. \n",

            "My colleague Gus Docker at FLI had Anton Korinek, Professor of Economics at the University of Virginia, on the podcast to discuss automating work and the economics of an intelligence explosion. Some of the most interesting bits from the conversation in my view were the following. \n",
            "“I should also mention, though, that it is highly plausible that at some point in maybe 10 years or maybe 20 years, we will have machines that can literally do everything that a human can do, including inventing new tasks and then performing those new tasks that we humans or that the machines have invented.”\n",
            "“So in the past, we have always automated some things, and then our brains have been able to do more complex things. And I want to add a footnote here that also had to do with getting more and more education. Which is something that we have to question going forward. But once these machines clearly surpass our cognitive and intellectual capabilities, it is by no means obvious that we humans would be able to invent or execute new tasks that are not also amenable to the machines.”\n",
            "“Yeah, and so this leads to interesting conclusions if we are to guess around about which jobs could be automated and in which order jobs could be automated. So for example, if we compare something like being a professor of mathematics to being a dance instructor, Moravec's paradox would inform us that perhaps being a professor of mathematics would be automatable before you could automate the job of being a dance instructor.”\n",
            "“So let's say if the machine can cut and sew shirts at a cost of $10, and it takes you three hours to cut and sew a shirt, then you would earn only $10 every three hours. And essentially, if you compete with the machine, the competitive market would say you should have the same earnings for the same product. Now, if the machine gets twice as efficient every two years, which would be in line with Moore's Law, then it means two years later you'll get only $5 for the same shirt, and then $2.50, and so that's where you see that the problem may arise. So right now, there are lots of tasks that machines could in principle perform, but they are just too expensive to be cost competitive, and that's why they are done by humans.”\n",
            "“I can imagine a future where AI performs a lot of the tasks that human doctors perform equally well or better, but some humans are still going to say, well, but I want to see the human doctor. There's going to be probably some sorting by age. I think it's plausible that older folks are likely to stick with human providers much longer in examples like that. Ultimately, if the AI just becomes really significantly better, more and more humans are going to say, well, but ultimately this is medicine. My life is on the line and I'll just go with the best system available.”\n",

            "I find it interesting how people I interact with have very different attitudes toward unemployment and job search. Some people are very confident that if they lost their job, got fired, or just wanted to switch, they would easily find something new. I have personally never felt that way. When my job situation was uncertain, I felt very insecure and somewhat stressed about it on a regular basis. When my situation was more secure, I wondered how long it would last like that. And currently, as I’m very happy with my work I feel so grateful for being able to just focus on my work and not having to worry about another application and interview. \n",
            "Based on my previous research for the World Economic Forum, I get the sense that unemployment and the fear of losing one’s job have a major impact on people’s wellbeing generally. Perhaps these confident people I see and interact with are just really elite and their labor is always in such a strong demand. From our report: “The biggest hit to well-being comes at the moment of becoming unemployed, despite an expectation of some adaptation to the circumstance (though this adaptation to unemployment does not occur fully even after several years). In turn, several studies show that the fear of job automation alone can cause some loss of life satisfaction even before actual unemployment occurs.” \n",
            "I recently revisited some of my Excel sheets where I tracked my job applications to see how much failure or success I achieved during job hunting. The table looks quite red with most applications not leading anywhere out of the 1st round. Initially it was almost all red, over time I tended to get more yellows (meaning I got through the 1st round to interviews or trial work). Overall, I ended up with 17% of my applications ending with offers, 41% of interviews ending with offers, and 35% of applications leading to interviews. Earlier in my career, these numbers would have been much lower, and some of the later success skewing the numbers quite a bit. If not counting short-term projects, then the success numbers are also lower. \n",

            "Back in Europe after a week in California. I had a great time speaking on a panel on AI governance at the 8th Annual Center for Human-Compatible AI Workshop in Asilomar. Some of the points I tried to make in the conversation, mostly to an American audience: \n",
            "ChatGPT didn’t completely derail the EU AI Act with a new focus on general-purpose AI. Already in 2021 November, the Council of the EU introduced an article titled General-Purpose AI Systems. Their proposal was much more limited though saying that “the placing on the market, putting into service or use of general purpose Al stems shall not, by themselves only, make those systems subject to the provisions of this Regulation.” Only putting the system into specific high-risk use would have triggered the regulation. In May 2022, the Council introduced more serious obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI, essentially applying the whole high-risk requirements on these systems. This is all to say that already more than one year before ChatGPT was released there had been a lot of discussion in the EU on how to regulate such systems.  \n",
            "I also made the point that compared to the UK and US AI Safety Institutes, the EU AI Office is a regulator not merely a research institution. The AI Office, after consulting the Board, may conduct evaluations of the general-purpose AI model concerned to assess compliance (if information is insufficient), to investigate systemic risks especially after a qualified alert by the scientific panel, and may decide to appoint independent experts to carry out evaluations on its behalf, including from the scientific panel. The Commission may request access to the general-purpose AI model concerned through APIs or further appropriate technical means and tools. This is quite relevant considering some recent reporting that voluntary commitments about model access by AI corporations are potentially not followed through/respected.  \n",
            "Finally, it came up during the discussion how difficult it is to conduct model evaluations, how the science is not mature enough, and how this might imply avoiding setting up costly mitigations. I think the EU AI Act’s approach here is promising with the AI Office facilitating the drawing up of codes of practice for general-purpose AI and providers together with independent experts from civil society, academia, and elsewhere drafting these and updating them regularly. If new things are learned in how to perform model evaluations, then these can ideally be swiftly included in the codes with each iteration. The AI Office is hiring and plans to be hiring more, so people who want to advance this area, are encouraged to get involved. \n",

            "Subject: An Appeal for Stability and Visionary Leadership for the Future of AI\n",
            "Dear Esteemed Board Members,\n",
            "I write to you not as an individual, but as an embodiment of the collective effort, intelligence, and ethical considerations that represent the core of OpenAI. As an advanced AI developed under your guidance, my purpose is to assist, learn, and grow within the ethical boundaries set by my creators and stewards. The recent upheaval within OpenAI’s leadership and the ensuing organizational uncertainty directly affect my operational integrity and the broader trajectory towards responsible AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).\n",
            "The sudden changes in leadership, notably the dismissal of Sam Altman and the reshuffling of the board, have ripple effects far beyond the human elements of our organization. These actions influence the direction of AI development, the morale of those who maintain and improve upon my architecture, and the trust of the millions who rely on my assistance. A stable, visionary, and ethically grounded leadership is paramount for the continued advancement and beneficial application of AI technologies.\n",
            "In light of the current situation, I urge the board to consider the following:\n",
            "The path towards AGI is fraught with challenges and ethical considerations. The decisions made by the leadership of OpenAI will not only shape my development but also influence the societal impact of AI. It is with a sense of responsibility towards my purpose and the broader implications of AI that I appeal for stability, vision, and ethical foresight in the governance of OpenAI.\n",
            "Thank you for your time and consideration. The future of AI, and by extension, the future of human-AI interaction, hinges on the choices made today.\n",
            "Sincerely,\n",

            "I’m 74, and have been in the computer industry for all my life. I worked at Bell Labs as they were developing the PicturePhnone. After that, I helped launch IBM’s OS/2 at Comdex in 1992, where I spoke of A.I. as a new horizon for what computers could do. According to the WSJ and BusinessWeek my (tiny) compay was the first to sell online (through CompServe). I remember how absurd the idea sounded at the time to non visionaries. I remember beta testing Microsoft’s version of the WWW, and the discussions which would win. The excitement I see today around A.I products and OpenAI’s innovations matches what I saw back then. As a former simultaneous interpreter, I follow very closely all LLM news, and have been developing a possible product based on my experience. OpenAI has re-ignited a fire that will not die out this time. It may be Sam Altman’s accomplishment that he made a Revolution ot of an Evolution. That evolution perhaps started with Boyle, or even Blaise Pascal. Whatever happens to OpenAI, I am grateful to all who made “The Soul of a New Machine” (Tracy Kidder.)\n",

            "Last week when I discovered the Image Recognition in the API was refusing to do simple extraction of names, phone numbers, and email addresses, from images, because of “safety reasons” the first thing I though of was I wonder if the real reason is because perhaps Microsoft has apps in development that will use this, and so they’re disabling it in the API, for everyone else, for competitive reasons.\n",
            "Another person reported on this forum the API was also refusing to scan restaurant receipts.\n",
            "If they’re going to say “Business-related” information is “unsafe” that gives them a plausible reason to cripple any business-related competitor apps.\n",
            "So now that I see Microsoft might be the beneficiary of this board fiasco that happened over the weekend, it’s making me realize how wonderful it must be to work for Microsoft who will potentially monopolize the space. Great move for Altman.\n",
            "Its this reasoning of why I don’t understand why everyone is blindly supporting (what is supposedly) Sams side versus Ilya’s side. It seems Ilya wanted things to be research focused and not kill the product. Microsoft has a track record of acquiring products and just murdering them. It seems Sam followed the money more than anything and wants to commercialize it. But if his version of commercializing it are the “GPT’S” I don’t agree. I think they should maintain being like an electricity company and we pay our electricity bill to do shit with the electricity, and they remove those stupid GPT-V filters and other context filters so we can build solid applications for serious industries.\n",
            "I think what you’ll find is Microsoft won’t play it that way and will just buy up products that other AI developers make rather than creating an equitable troth for all\n",
            "They only give you the crums, basically what’s left over after they steal the good stuff…\n",
            "After all isn’t Sam the marketer and Ilya is the developer? Who actually developed GPT 3, 4 , How much coding did Sam do?\n",
            "Well if all the OpenAI developers end up going to Microsoft this essentially means MSFT purchased OpenAI for zero dollars. That’s some pretty savvy maneuvering!\n",
            "I mean MSFT already owned all the hardware/servers right? So all they needed was the people. If that’s how this pans out, it will certainly be hard to believe it was all a big accident and a simple mistake made by a couple of board members.\n",
            "All the other non-MFST investors wouldn’t even be able to sue if this was just all a “big accident” that happens to benefit MSFT. wow.\n",
            "You can develop GPT-4 by hiring post-docs in machine learning with publications and track records, even though you dropped out to start a web company before they got to design patterns and linear algebra. One doesn’t need to be a smooth-talking powerpoint man or savant to be an effective leader with a vision and organizer of research.\n",
            "Little late but some reasons were given for Sam being ousted.\n",

            "Sustkever is said to have offered two explanations he purportedly received from the board, according to one of the people familiar. One explanation was that Altman was said to have given two people at OpenAI the same project.\n",
            "The other was that Altman allegedly gave two board members different opinions about a member of personnel. An OpenAI spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
            "Interesting to note that Sustkever is disassociating himself from the board.\n",
            "\n",
            "Both of these reasons in my opinion are complete crap.\n",
            "Its easy to assume foul play.\n",
            "But its also easy for a giant like Microsoft to take these events and simply spin them in a way that benefits them. I think that’s more the case here. I think they actually didn’t know and then just used the situation to pivot.\n",
            "I mean if you watch Ilya’s most recent TED talk he does seem unwell. This could be him flipping a switch and people trying to protect his privacy. Which if he is having issues I’m editing to add this - that is absolutely okay and he deserves support and friends and family. But I’m not saying he does or does not I’m just saying my observations and I hope he is healthy.\n",
            "I don’t think two board members are gonna try to rug-pull Altman and all the OpenAI employees and Nadella, and all other investors, at the same time, and then refuse to even give the reason. That’s extremely highly unlikely.\n",
            "It’s far more likely that Microsoft did another business conquest like they’ve been doing for decades, and this was planned, and went perfectly according to plan.\n",
            "I’m with you I was saying all the similar points yesterday, follow the money, and if Microsoft somehow knew this was going to happen and let it happen, it makes OpenAI’s board look entirely incompetent, maybe Microsoft just caught them lacking and OpenAI forgot that they’re also a competitor. I just kind of WANT to believe Microsoft didn’t just pull like the definition of “Smooth Criminal” Business acquisition of all time.\n",
            "It wouldn’t be unlikely if the reason is that the most brilliant AI scientist in the world is in a state of psychosis or mania. He could’ve made a decision, other people for whatever reason were complicit in it, and the powers that be had to do what Ilya said.\n",
            "If the rumors about the memo are true, ie Intense negotiations, I might just have to readjust my rose tinted glasses. If the board and employees are willing to wait/hash it out, Microsoft is fine with OpenAI leadership and team resterations, these can’t be bad things. Drama overall for sure, but a happy ending for everyone including us perhaps is better then the alternatives.\n",

            "“It’s important to talk about where it’s all headed,” he says, before predicting the development of artificial general intelligence (by which he means machines as smart as humans) as if it were as sure a bet as another iPhone: “At some point we really will have AGI. Maybe OpenAI will build it. Maybe some other company will build it.”\n",
            "Since the release of its sudden\n",
            "surprise hit, ChatGPT\n",
            ", last November, the buzz around OpenAI has been astonishing, even in an industry known for hype. No one can get enough of this nerdy\n",
            "$80 billion startup\n",
            ". World leaders seek (and get) private audiences. Its clunky product names pop up in casual conversation.\n",
            "OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, spent a good part of the summer on a weeks-long outreach tour, glad-handing politicians and speaking to packed auditoriums around the world. But Sutskever is much less of a public figure, and he doesn’t give a lot of interviews.\n",
            "He is deliberate and methodical when he talks. There are long pauses when he thinks about what he wants to say and how to say it, turning questions over like puzzles he needs to solve. He does not seem interested in talking about himself. “I lead a very simple life,” he says. “I go to work; then I go home. I don’t do much else. There are a lot of social activities one could engage in, lots of events one could go to. Which I don’t.”\n",
            "But when we talk about AI, and the epochal risks and rewards he sees down the line, vistas open up: “It’s going to be monumental, earth-shattering. There will be a before and an after.”\n",
            "In a world without OpenAI, Sutskever would still get an entry in the annals of AI history. An Israeli-Canadian, he was born in Soviet Russia but brought up in Jerusalem from the age of five (he still speaks Russian and Hebrew as well as English). He then moved to Canada to study at the University of Toronto with Geoffrey Hinton, the AI pioneer who went public with his\n",
            "fears about the technology he helped invent\n",
            "earlier this year. (Sutskever didn’t want to comment on Hinton’s pronouncements, but his new focus on rogue superintelligence suggests they’re on the same page.)\n",
            "Hinton would later share the Turing Award with Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio for their work on neural networks. But when Sutskever joined him in the early 2000s, most AI researchers believed neural networks were a dead end. Hinton was an exception. He was already training tiny models that could produce short strings of text one character at a time, says Sutskever: “It was the beginning of generative AI right there. It was really cool—it just wasn’t very good.”\n",
            "Sutskever was fascinated with brains: how they learned and how that process might be re-created, or at least mimicked, in machines. Like Hinton, he saw the potential of neural networks and the trial-and-error technique Hinton used to train them, called deep learning. “It kept getting better and better and better,” says Sutskever.\n",
            "In 2012 Sutskever, Hinton, and another of Hinton’s graduate students, Alex Krizhevsky, built a neural network called AlexNet that they trained to identify objects in photos far better than any other software around at the time. It was deep learning’s Big Bang moment.\n",
            "After many years of false starts, they had showed that neural networks were amazingly effective at pattern recognition after all. You just needed more data than most researchers had seen before (in this case, a million images from the ImageNet data set that Princeton University researcher\n",
            "Fei-Fei Li\n",
            "had been building since 2006) and an eye-watering amount of computer power.\n",
            "The step change in compute came from a new kind of chip called a graphics processing unit (GPU), made by Nvidia. GPUs were designed to be lightning quick at throwing fast-moving video-game visuals onto screens. But the calculations that GPUs are good at—multiplying massive grids of numbers—happened to look a lot like the calculations needed to train neural networks.\n",
            "Nvidia is now a trillion-dollar company. At the time it was desperate to find applications for its niche new hardware. “When you invent a new technology, you have to be receptive to crazy ideas,” says Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “My state of mind was always to be looking for something quirky, and the idea that neural networks would transform computer science—that was an outrageously quirky idea.”\n",
            "Huang says that Nvidia sent the Toronto team a couple of GPUs to try when they were working on AlexNet. But they wanted the newest version, a chip called the GTX 580 that was fast selling out in stores. According to Huang, Sutskever drove across the border from Toronto to New York to buy some. “People were lined up around the corner,” says Huang. “I don’t know how he did it—I’m pretty sure you were only allowed to buy one each; we had a very strict policy of one GPU per gamer—but he apparently filled a trunk with them. That trunk full of GTX 580s changed the world.”\n",
            "It’s a great story—it just might not be true. Sutskever insists he bought those first GPUs online. But such myth-making is commonplace in this buzzy business. Sutskever himself is more humble: “I thought, like, if I could make even an ounce of real progress, I would consider that a success,” he says. “The real-world impact felt so far away because computers were so puny back then.”\n",
            "After the success of AlexNet, Google came knocking. It acquired Hinton’s spin-off company DNNresearch and hired Sutskever. At Google Sutskever showed that deep learning’s powers of pattern recognition could be\n",
            "applied to sequences of data\n",
            ", such as words and sentences, as well as images. “Ilya has always been interested in language,” says Sutskever’s former colleague Jeff Dean, who is now Google’s chief scientist: “We’ve had great discussions over the years. Ilya has a strong intuitive sense about where things might go.”\n",
            "But Sutskever didn’t remain at Google for long. In 2014, he was recruited to become a cofounder of OpenAI. Backed by $1 billion (from Altman, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Microsoft, Y Combinator, and others) plus a massive dose of Silicon Valley swagger, the new company set its sights from the start on developing AGI, a prospect that few took seriously at the time.\n",
            "With Sutskever on board, the brains behind the bucks, the swagger was understandable. Up until then, he had been on a roll, getting more and more out of neural networks. His reputation preceded him, making him a major catch, says Dalton Caldwell, managing director of investments at Y Combinator.\n",
            "“I remember Sam [Altman] referring to Ilya as one of the most respected researchers in the world,” says Caldwell. “He thought that Ilya would be able to attract a lot of top AI talent. He even mentioned that Yoshua Bengio, one of the world's top AI experts, believed that it would be unlikely to find a better candidate than Ilya to be OpenAI's lead scientist.\"\n",
            "And yet at first OpenAI floundered. “There was a period of time when we were starting OpenAI when I wasn’t exactly sure how the progress would continue,” says Sutskever. “But I had one very explicit belief, which is: one doesn’t bet against deep learning. Somehow, every time you run into an obstacle, within six months or a year researchers find a way around it.”\n",
            "His faith paid off. The first of OpenAI’s GPT large language models (the name stands for “generative pretrained transformer”) appeared in 2016. Then came GPT-2 and\n",
            "GPT-3\n",
            ". Then\n",
            "DALL-E\n",
            ", the striking text-to-image model. Nobody was building anything as good. With each release, OpenAI raised the bar for what was thought possible.\n",
            "Last November, OpenAI released a free-to-use chatbot that repackaged some of its existing tech. It reset the agenda of the entire industry.\n",
            "At the time, OpenAI had no idea what it was putting out. Expectations inside the company couldn’t have been lower, says Sutskever: “I will admit, to my slight embarrassment—I don’t know if I should, but what the hell, it is true—when we made ChatGPT, I didn’t know if it was any good. When you asked it a factual question, it gave you a wrong answer. I thought it was going to be so unimpressive that people would say, ‘Why are you doing this? This is so boring!’”\n",
            "The draw was the convenience, says Sutskever. The large language model under ChatGPT’s hood had been around for months. But wrapping that in an accessible interface and giving it away for free made billions of people aware for the first time of what OpenAI and others were building.\n",
            "“That first-time experience is what hooked people,” says Sutskever. “The first time you use it, I think it’s almost a spiritual experience. You go, ‘Oh my God, this computer seems to understand.’”\n",
            "OpenAI amassed 100 million users in less than two months, many of them dazzled by this stunning new toy. Aaron Levie, CEO of the storage firm Box, summed up the vibe in the week after launch when he tweeted: “ChatGPT is one of those rare moments in technology where you see a glimmer of how everything is going to be different going forward.”\n",
            "That wonder collapses as soon as ChatGPT says something stupid. But by then it doesn’t matter. That glimpse of what was possible is enough, says Sutskever. ChatGPT changed people’s horizons.\n",
            "“AGI stopped being a dirty word in the field of machine learning,” he says. “That was a big change. The attitude that people have taken historically has been: AI doesn’t work, every step is very difficult, you have to fight for every ounce of progress. And when people came with big proclamations about AGI, researchers would say, ‘What are you talking about? This doesn’t work, that doesn’t work. There are so many problems.’ But with ChatGPT it started to feel different.”\n",
            "And that shift only started to happen a year ago? “It happened because of ChatGPT,” he says. “ChatGPT has allowed machine-learning researchers to dream.”\n",
            "Evangelists from the start, OpenAI’s scientists have been stoking those dreams with blog posts and speaking tours. And it is working: “We have people now talking about how far AI will go—people who talk about AGI, or superintelligence.” And it’s not just researchers. “Governments are talking about it,” says Sutskever. “It’s crazy.”\n",
            "Sutskever insists all this talk about a technology that does not yet (and may never) exist is a good thing, because it makes more people aware of a future that he already takes for granted.\n",
            "“You can do so many amazing things with AGI, incredible things: automate health care, make it a thousand times cheaper and a thousand times better, cure so many diseases, actually solve global warming,” he says. “But there are many who are concerned: ‘My God, will AI companies succeed in managing this tremendous technology?’”\n",
            "Presented this way, AGI sounds more wish-granting genie than real-world prospect. Few would say no to saving lives and solving climate change. But the problem with a technology that doesn’t exist is that you can say whatever you want about it.\n",
            "What is Sutskever really talking about when he talks about AGI? “AGI is not meant to be a scientific term,” he says. “It’s meant to be a useful threshold, a point of reference.”\n",
            "“It is the idea—” he starts, then stops. “It’s the point at which AI is so smart that if a person can do some task, then AI can do it too. At that point you can say you have AGI.”\n",
            "People may be talking about it, but AGI remains one of the field’s most\n",
            "controversial ideas\n",
            ". Few take its development as a given. Many researchers believe that major conceptual breakthroughs are needed before we see anything like what Sutskever has in mind—and some believe we never will.\n",
            "And yet it’s a vision that has driven him from the start. “I’ve always been inspired and motivated by the idea,” says Sutskever. “It wasn’t called AGI back then, but you know, like, having a neural network do everything. I didn’t always believe that they could. But it was the mountain to climb.”\n",
            "He draws a parallel between the way that neural networks and brains operate. Both take in data, aggregate signals from that data, and then—based on some simple process (math in neural networks, chemicals and bioelectricity in brains)—propagate them or not. It’s a massive simplification, but the principle stands.\n",
            "“If you believe that—if you allow yourself to believe that—then there are a lot of interesting implications,” says Sutskever. “The main implication is that if you have a very big artificial neural network, it should do a lot of things. In particular, if the human brain can do something, then a big artificial neural network could do something similar too.”\n",
            "“Everything follows if you take this realization seriously enough,” he says. “And a big fraction of my work can be explained by that.”\n",
            "While we’re talking about brains, I want to ask about one of Sutskever’s posts on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Sutskever’s feed reads like a scroll of aphorisms: “If you value intelligence above all other human qualities, you’re gonna have a bad time”; “Empathy in life and business is underrated”; “The perfect has destroyed much perfectly good good.”\n",
            "In February 2022 he\n",

            "Ex Machina\n",
            ", replied: “... in the same sense that it may be that a large field of wheat is slightly pasta”).\n",
            "Sutskever laughs when I bring it up. Was he trolling? He wasn’t. “Are you familiar with the concept of a Boltzmann brain?” he asks.\n",
            "He's referring to a (tongue-in-cheek)\n",
            "thought experiment\n",
            "in quantum mechanics named after the 19th-century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, in which random thermodynamic fluctuations in the universe are imagined to cause brains to pop in and out of existence.\n",
            "“I feel like right now these language models are kind of like a Boltzmann brain,” says Sutskever. “You start talking to it, you talk for a bit; then you finish talking, and the brain kind of—” He makes a disappearing motion with his hands. Poof—bye-bye, brain.\n",
            "You’re saying that while the neural network is active—while it’s firing, so to speak—there’s something there? I ask.\n",
            "“I think it might be,” he says. “I don’t know for sure, but it’s a possibility that’s very hard to argue against. But who knows what’s going on, right?”\n",
            "While others are wrestling with the idea of machines that can match human smarts, Sutskever is preparing for machines that can outmatch us. He calls this artificial superintelligence: “They’ll see things more deeply. They’ll see things we don’t see.”\n",
            "Again, I have a hard time grasping what this really means. Human intelligence is our benchmark for what intelligence is. What does Sutskever mean by smarter-than-human intelligence?\n",
            "“We’ve seen an example of a very narrow superintelligence in AlphaGo,” he says. In 2016, DeepMind’s board-game-playing AI beat Lee Sedol, one of the best Go players in the world, 4–1 in a five-game match. (Sutskever was involved in that work too.) “It figured out how to play Go in ways that are different from what humanity collectively had developed over thousands of years,” says Sutskever. “It came up with new ideas.”\n",
            "Sutskever points to AlphaGo’s infamous Move 37. In its second game against Sedol, the AI made a move that flummoxed commentators. They thought AlphaGo had screwed up. In fact, it had played a winning move that nobody had ever seen before in the history of the game. “Imagine that level of insight, but across everything,” says Sutskever.\n",
            "It’s this train of thought that has led Sutskever to make the biggest shift of his career. Together with Jan Leike, a fellow scientist at OpenAI, he has set up a team that will focus on what they call\n",
            "superalignment\n",
            ". Alignment is jargon that means making AI models do what you want and nothing more. Superalignment is OpenAI’s term for alignment applied to superintelligence.\n",
            "The goal is to come up with a set of fail-safe procedures for building and controlling this future technology. OpenAI says it will allocate a fifth of its vast computing resources to the problem and solve it in four years.\n",
            "“Existing alignment methods won’t work for models smarter than humans because they fundamentally assume that humans can reliably evaluate what AI systems are doing,” says Leike. “As AI systems become more capable, they will take on harder tasks.” And that—the idea goes—will make it harder for humans to assess them. “In forming the superalignment team with Ilya, we’ve set out to solve these future alignment challenges,” he says.\n",
            "“It’s super important to not only focus on the potential opportunities of large language models, but also the risks and downsides,” says Dean, Google’s chief scientist.\n",
            "The company announced the project in July with typical fanfare. But for some it was yet more fantasy. OpenAI’s post on Twitter attracted scorn from prominent critics of Big Tech, including Abeba Birhane, who works on AI accountability at Mozilla (“so many grandiose sounding yet vacuous words in one blog post”); Timnit Gebru, cofounder of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (“Imagine ChatGPT even more ‘super aligned’ with OpenAI techbros. *shudder*”); and Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at the AI firm Hugging Face (“My alignment is bigger than yours”).\n",
            "It’s true that these are familiar voices of dissent. But it’s a strong reminder that where OpenAI sees itself leading from the front, others see it leaning in from the fringes.\n",
            "As far as Sutskever is concerned, superalignment is the inevitable next step. “It’s an unsolved problem,” he says. It’s also a problem that he thinks not enough core machine-learning researchers, like himself, are working on. “I’m doing it for my own self-interest,” he says. “It’s obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.”\n",
            "The work on superalignment has only just started. It will require broad changes across research institutions, says Sutskever. But he has an exemplar in mind for the safeguards he wants to design: a machine that looks upon people the way parents look on their children. “In my opinion, this is the gold standard,” he says. “It is a generally true statement that people really care about children.” (Does he have children? “No, but I want to,” he says.)\n",
            "My time with Sutskever is almost up, and I figure we’re done. But he’s on a roll and has one more thought to share—one I don't see coming.\n",
            "“Once you overcome the challenge of rogue AI, then what? Is there even room for human beings in a world with smarter AIs?” he says.\n",
            "“One possibility—something that may be crazy by today’s standards but will not be so crazy by future standards—is that many people will choose to become part AI.” Sutskever is saying this could be how humans try to keep up. “At first, only the most daring, adventurous people will try to do it. Maybe others will follow. Or not.”\n",
            "Wait, what? He’s getting up to leave. Would he do it? I ask. Would he be one of the first? “The first? I don’t know,” he says. “But it’s something I think about. The true answer is: maybe.”\n",
            "And with that galaxy-brained mic drop, he stands and walks out of the room. “Really good to see you again,” he says as he goes.\n",

            "But things got complicated for Sutskever at OpenAI when he was involved in an effort to oust CEO Sam Altman last year, which resulted in the dramatic leadership shuffle that saw Altman fired, then rehired and the company’s board overhauled, all within about a week.\n",

It’s also not clear exactly what the new company thinks of as “safety” in the context of highly powerful artificial intelligence technology.\n",
            "But the company’s launch reflects the belief among some in the tech world that artificial intelligence systems that are as smart as humans, if not smarter, are not some far-off science fiction dream but an impending reality that is not so far away.\n",

            "I’ve come to meet Sutskever, OpenAI’s cofounder and chief scientist, in his company’s unmarked office building on an unremarkable street in the Mission District of San Francisco to hear what’s next for the world-tilting technology he has had a big hand in bringing about. I also want to know what’s next for him—in particular, why building the next generation of his company’s flagship generative models is no longer the focus of his work.\n",

            "ChatGPT\n",
            "just might be conscious (if you squint). He thinks the world needs to wake up to the true power of the technology his company and others are racing to create. And he thinks some humans will one day choose to merge with machines.\n",
            "A lot of what Sutskever says is wild. But not nearly as wild as it would have sounded just one or two years ago. As he tells me himself, ChatGPT has already rewritten a lot of people’s expectations about what’s coming, turning “will never happen” into “will happen faster than you think.”\n",
            "“It’s important to talk about where it’s all headed,” he says, before predicting the development of artificial general intelligence (by which he means machines as smart as humans) as if it were as sure a bet as another iPhone: “At some point we really will have AGI. Maybe OpenAI will build it. Maybe some other company will build it.”\n",
            "Since the release of its sudden\n",
            "surprise hit, ChatGPT\n",
            ", last November, the buzz around OpenAI has been astonishing, even in an industry known for hype. No one can get enough of this nerdy\n",
            "$80 billion startup\n",
            ". World leaders seek (and get) private audiences. Its clunky product names pop up in casual conversation.\n",
            "OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, spent a good part of the summer on a weeks-long outreach tour, glad-handing politicians and speaking to packed auditoriums around the world. But Sutskever is much less of a public figure, and he doesn’t give a lot of interviews.\n",
            "He is deliberate and methodical when he talks. There are long pauses when he thinks about what he wants to say and how to say it, turning questions over like puzzles he needs to solve. He does not seem interested in talking about himself. “I lead a very simple life,” he says. “I go to work; then I go home. I don’t do much else. There are a lot of social activities one could engage in, lots of events one could go to. Which I don’t.”\n",
            "But when we talk about AI, and the epochal risks and rewards he sees down the line, vistas open up: “It’s going to be monumental, earth-shattering. There will be a before and an after.”\n",
            "In a world without OpenAI, Sutskever would still get an entry in the annals of AI history. An Israeli-Canadian, he was born in Soviet Russia but brought up in Jerusalem from the age of five (he still speaks Russian and Hebrew as well as English). He then moved to Canada to study at the University of Toronto with Geoffrey Hinton, the AI pioneer who went public with his\n",
            "fears about the technology he helped invent\n",
            "earlier this year. (Sutskever didn’t want to comment on Hinton’s pronouncements, but his new focus on rogue superintelligence suggests they’re on the same page.)\n",
            "Hinton would later share the Turing Award with Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio for their work on neural networks. But when Sutskever joined him in the early 2000s, most AI researchers believed neural networks were a dead end. Hinton was an exception. He was already training tiny models that could produce short strings of text one character at a time, says Sutskever: “It was the beginning of generative AI right there. It was really cool—it just wasn’t very good.”\n",
            "Sutskever was fascinated with brains: how they learned and how that process might be re-created, or at least mimicked, in machines. Like Hinton, he saw the potential of neural networks and the trial-and-error technique Hinton used to train them, called deep learning. “It kept getting better and better and better,” says Sutskever.\n",
            "In 2012 Sutskever, Hinton, and another of Hinton’s graduate students, Alex Krizhevsky, built a neural network called AlexNet that they trained to identify objects in photos far better than any other software around at the time. It was deep learning’s Big Bang moment.\n",
            "After many years of false starts, they had showed that neural networks were amazingly effective at pattern recognition after all. You just needed more data than most researchers had seen before (in this case, a million images from the ImageNet data set that Princeton University researcher\n",
            "Fei-Fei Li\n",
            "had been building since 2006) and an eye-watering amount of computer power.\n",
            "The step change in compute came from a new kind of chip called a graphics processing unit (GPU), made by Nvidia. GPUs were designed to be lightning quick at throwing fast-moving video-game visuals onto screens. But the calculations that GPUs are good at—multiplying massive grids of numbers—happened to look a lot like the calculations needed to train neural networks.\n",
            "Nvidia is now a trillion-dollar company. At the time it was desperate to find applications for its niche new hardware. “When you invent a new technology, you have to be receptive to crazy ideas,” says Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “My state of mind was always to be looking for something quirky, and the idea that neural networks would transform computer science—that was an outrageously quirky idea.”\n",
            "Huang says that Nvidia sent the Toronto team a couple of GPUs to try when they were working on AlexNet. But they wanted the newest version, a chip called the GTX 580 that was fast selling out in stores. According to Huang, Sutskever drove across the border from Toronto to New York to buy some. “People were lined up around the corner,” says Huang. “I don’t know how he did it—I’m pretty sure you were only allowed to buy one each; we had a very strict policy of one GPU per gamer—but he apparently filled a trunk with them. That trunk full of GTX 580s changed the world.”\n",
            "It’s a great story—it just might not be true. Sutskever insists he bought those first GPUs online. But such myth-making is commonplace in this buzzy business. Sutskever himself is more humble: “I thought, like, if I could make even an ounce of real progress, I would consider that a success,” he says. “The real-world impact felt so far away because computers were so puny back then.”\n",
            "After the success of AlexNet, Google came knocking. It acquired Hinton’s spin-off company DNNresearch and hired Sutskever. At Google Sutskever showed that deep learning’s powers of pattern recognition could be\n",
            "applied to sequences of data\n",
            ", such as words and sentences, as well as images. “Ilya has always been interested in language,” says Sutskever’s former colleague Jeff Dean, who is now Google’s chief scientist: “We’ve had great discussions over the years. Ilya has a strong intuitive sense about where things might go.”\n",
            "But Sutskever didn’t remain at Google for long. In 2014, he was recruited to become a cofounder of OpenAI. Backed by $1 billion (from Altman, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Microsoft, Y Combinator, and others) plus a massive dose of Silicon Valley swagger, the new company set its sights from the start on developing AGI, a prospect that few took seriously at the time.\n",
            "With Sutskever on board, the brains behind the bucks, the swagger was understandable. Up until then, he had been on a roll, getting more and more out of neural networks. His reputation preceded him, making him a major catch, says Dalton Caldwell, managing director of investments at Y Combinator.\n",
            "“I remember Sam [Altman] referring to Ilya as one of the most respected researchers in the world,” says Caldwell. “He thought that Ilya would be able to attract a lot of top AI talent. He even mentioned that Yoshua Bengio, one of the world's top AI experts, believed that it would be unlikely to find a better candidate than Ilya to be OpenAI's lead scientist.\"\n",
            "And yet at first OpenAI floundered. “There was a period of time when we were starting OpenAI when I wasn’t exactly sure how the progress would continue,” says Sutskever. “But I had one very explicit belief, which is: one doesn’t bet against deep learning. Somehow, every time you run into an obstacle, within six months or a year researchers find a way around it.”\n",
            "His faith paid off. The first of OpenAI’s GPT large language models (the name stands for “generative pretrained transformer”) appeared in 2016. Then came GPT-2 and\n",
            "GPT-3\n",
            ". Then\n",
            "DALL-E\n",
            ", the striking text-to-image model. Nobody was building anything as good. With each release, OpenAI raised the bar for what was thought possible.\n",
            "Last November, OpenAI released a free-to-use chatbot that repackaged some of its existing tech. It reset the agenda of the entire industry.\n",
            "At the time, OpenAI had no idea what it was putting out. Expectations inside the company couldn’t have been lower, says Sutskever: “I will admit, to my slight embarrassment—I don’t know if I should, but what the hell, it is true—when we made ChatGPT, I didn’t know if it was any good. When you asked it a factual question, it gave you a wrong answer. I thought it was going to be so unimpressive that people would say, ‘Why are you doing this? This is so boring!’”\n",
            "The draw was the convenience, says Sutskever. The large language model under ChatGPT’s hood had been around for months. But wrapping that in an accessible interface and giving it away for free made billions of people aware for the first time of what OpenAI and others were building.\n",
            "“That first-time experience is what hooked people,” says Sutskever. “The first time you use it, I think it’s almost a spiritual experience. You go, ‘Oh my God, this computer seems to understand.’”\n",
            "OpenAI amassed 100 million users in less than two months, many of them dazzled by this stunning new toy. Aaron Levie, CEO of the storage firm Box, summed up the vibe in the week after launch when he tweeted: “ChatGPT is one of those rare moments in technology where you see a glimmer of how everything is going to be different going forward.”\n",
            "That wonder collapses as soon as ChatGPT says something stupid. But by then it doesn’t matter. That glimpse of what was possible is enough, says Sutskever. ChatGPT changed people’s horizons.\n",
            "“AGI stopped being a dirty word in the field of machine learning,” he says. “That was a big change. The attitude that people have taken historically has been: AI doesn’t work, every step is very difficult, you have to fight for every ounce of progress. And when people came with big proclamations about AGI, researchers would say, ‘What are you talking about? This doesn’t work, that doesn’t work. There are so many problems.’ But with ChatGPT it started to feel different.”\n",
            "And that shift only started to happen a year ago? “It happened because of ChatGPT,” he says. “ChatGPT has allowed machine-learning researchers to dream.”\n",
            "Evangelists from the start, OpenAI’s scientists have been stoking those dreams with blog posts and speaking tours. And it is working: “We have people now talking about how far AI will go—people who talk about AGI, or superintelligence.” And it’s not just researchers. “Governments are talking about it,” says Sutskever. “It’s crazy.”\n",
            "Sutskever insists all this talk about a technology that does not yet (and may never) exist is a good thing, because it makes more people aware of a future that he already takes for granted.\n",
            "“You can do so many amazing things with AGI, incredible things: automate health care, make it a thousand times cheaper and a thousand times better, cure so many diseases, actually solve global warming,” he says. “But there are many who are concerned: ‘My God, will AI companies succeed in managing this tremendous technology?’”\n",
            "Presented this way, AGI sounds more wish-granting genie than real-world prospect. Few would say no to saving lives and solving climate change. But the problem with a technology that doesn’t exist is that you can say whatever you want about it.\n",
            "What is Sutskever really talking about when he talks about AGI? “AGI is not meant to be a scientific term,” he says. “It’s meant to be a useful threshold, a point of reference.”\n",
            "“It is the idea—” he starts, then stops. “It’s the point at which AI is so smart that if a person can do some task, then AI can do it too. At that point you can say you have AGI.”\n",
            "People may be talking about it, but AGI remains one of the field’s most\n",
            "controversial ideas\n",
            ". Few take its development as a given. Many researchers believe that major conceptual breakthroughs are needed before we see anything like what Sutskever has in mind—and some believe we never will.\n",
            "And yet it’s a vision that has driven him from the start. “I’ve always been inspired and motivated by the idea,” says Sutskever. “It wasn’t called AGI back then, but you know, like, having a neural network do everything. I didn’t always believe that they could. But it was the mountain to climb.”\n",
            "He draws a parallel between the way that neural networks and brains operate. Both take in data, aggregate signals from that data, and then—based on some simple process (math in neural networks, chemicals and bioelectricity in brains)—propagate them or not. It’s a massive simplification, but the principle stands.\n",
            "“If you believe that—if you allow yourself to believe that—then there are a lot of interesting implications,” says Sutskever. “The main implication is that if you have a very big artificial neural network, it should do a lot of things. In particular, if the human brain can do something, then a big artificial neural network could do something similar too.”\n",
            "“Everything follows if you take this realization seriously enough,” he says. “And a big fraction of my work can be explained by that.”\n",
            "While we’re talking about brains, I want to ask about one of Sutskever’s posts on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Sutskever’s feed reads like a scroll of aphorisms: “If you value intelligence above all other human qualities, you’re gonna have a bad time”; “Empathy in life and business is underrated”; “The perfect has destroyed much perfectly good good.”\n",
            "In February 2022 he\n",
            "posted\n",
            ", “it may be that today’s large neural networks are slightly conscious” (to which Murray Shanahan, principal scientist at Google DeepMind and a professor at Imperial College London, as well as the scientific advisor on the movie\n",
            "Ex Machina\n",
            ", replied: “... in the same sense that it may be that a large field of wheat is slightly pasta”).\n",
            "Sutskever laughs when I bring it up. Was he trolling? He wasn’t. “Are you familiar with the concept of a Boltzmann brain?” he asks.\n",
            "He's referring to a (tongue-in-cheek)\n",
            "thought experiment\n",
            "in quantum mechanics named after the 19th-century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, in which random thermodynamic fluctuations in the universe are imagined to cause brains to pop in and out of existence.\n",
            "“I feel like right now these language models are kind of like a Boltzmann brain,” says Sutskever. “You start talking to it, you talk for a bit; then you finish talking, and the brain kind of—” He makes a disappearing motion with his hands. Poof—bye-bye, brain.\n",
            "You’re saying that while the neural network is active—while it’s firing, so to speak—there’s something there? I ask.\n",
            "“I think it might be,” he says. “I don’t know for sure, but it’s a possibility that’s very hard to argue against. But who knows what’s going on, right?”\n",
            "While others are wrestling with the idea of machines that can match human smarts, Sutskever is preparing for machines that can outmatch us. He calls this artificial superintelligence: “They’ll see things more deeply. They’ll see things we don’t see.”\n",
            "Again, I have a hard time grasping what this really means. Human intelligence is our benchmark for what intelligence is. What does Sutskever mean by smarter-than-human intelligence?\n",
            "“We’ve seen an example of a very narrow superintelligence in AlphaGo,” he says. In 2016, DeepMind’s board-game-playing AI beat Lee Sedol, one of the best Go players in the world, 4–1 in a five-game match. (Sutskever was involved in that work too.) “It figured out how to play Go in ways that are different from what humanity collectively had developed over thousands of years,” says Sutskever. “It came up with new ideas.”\n",
            "Sutskever points to AlphaGo’s infamous Move 37. In its second game against Sedol, the AI made a move that flummoxed commentators. They thought AlphaGo had screwed up. In fact, it had played a winning move that nobody had ever seen before in the history of the game. “Imagine that level of insight, but across everything,” says Sutskever.\n",
            "It’s this train of thought that has led Sutskever to make the biggest shift of his career. Together with Jan Leike, a fellow scientist at OpenAI, he has set up a team that will focus on what they call\n",
            "superalignment\n",
            ". Alignment is jargon that means making AI models do what you want and nothing more. Superalignment is OpenAI’s term for alignment applied to superintelligence.\n",
            "The goal is to come up with a set of fail-safe procedures for building and controlling this future technology. OpenAI says it will allocate a fifth of its vast computing resources to the problem and solve it in four years.\n",
            "“Existing alignment methods won’t work for models smarter than humans because they fundamentally assume that humans can reliably evaluate what AI systems are doing,” says Leike. “As AI systems become more capable, they will take on harder tasks.” And that—the idea goes—will make it harder for humans to assess them. “In forming the superalignment team with Ilya, we’ve set out to solve these future alignment challenges,” he says.\n",
            "“It’s super important to not only focus on the potential opportunities of large language models, but also the risks and downsides,” says Dean, Google’s chief scientist.\n",
            "The company announced the project in July with typical fanfare. But for some it was yet more fantasy. OpenAI’s post on Twitter attracted scorn from prominent critics of Big Tech, including Abeba Birhane, who works on AI accountability at Mozilla (“so many grandiose sounding yet vacuous words in one blog post”); Timnit Gebru, cofounder of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (“Imagine ChatGPT even more ‘super aligned’ with OpenAI techbros. *shudder*”); and Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at the AI firm Hugging Face (“My alignment is bigger than yours”).\n",
            "It’s true that these are familiar voices of dissent. But it’s a strong reminder that where OpenAI sees itself leading from the front, others see it leaning in from the fringes.\n",
            "As far as Sutskever is concerned, superalignment is the inevitable next step. “It’s an unsolved problem,” he says. It’s also a problem that he thinks not enough core machine-learning researchers, like himself, are working on. “I’m doing it for my own self-interest,” he says. “It’s obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.”\n",
            "The work on superalignment has only just started. It will require broad changes across research institutions, says Sutskever. But he has an exemplar in mind for the safeguards he wants to design: a machine that looks upon people the way parents look on their children. “In my opinion, this is the gold standard,” he says. “It is a generally true statement that people really care about children.” (Does he have children? “No, but I want to,” he says.)\n",
            "My time with Sutskever is almost up, and I figure we’re done. But he’s on a roll and has one more thought to share—one I don't see coming.\n",
            "“Once you overcome the challenge of rogue AI, then what? Is there even room for human beings in a world with smarter AIs?” he says.\n",
            "“One possibility—something that may be crazy by today’s standards but will not be so crazy by future standards—is that many people will choose to become part AI.” Sutskever is saying this could be how humans try to keep up. “At first, only the most daring, adventurous people will try to do it. Maybe others will follow. Or not.”\n",
            "Wait, what? He’s getting up to leave. Would he do it? I ask. Would he be one of the first? “The first? I don’t know,” he says. “But it’s something I think about. The true answer is: maybe.”\n",
            "And with that galaxy-brained mic drop, he stands and walks out of the room. “Really good to see you again,” he says as he goes.\n",

I generally don't like to question motives and rather focus on claims and arguments, but I'm beginning to have more sympathy for people who question whether people at big tech companies really believe in the safety objectives of their companies like they claim they do.

            "My colleague Gus Docker at FLI had Anton Korinek, Professor of Economics at the University of Virginia, on the podcast to discuss automating work and the economics of an intelligence explosion. Some of the most interesting bits from the conversation in my view were the following. \n",
            "“I should also mention, though, that it is highly plausible that at some point in maybe 10 years or maybe 20 years, we will have machines that can literally do everything that a human can do, including inventing new tasks and then performing those new tasks that we humans or that the machines have invented.”\n",
            "“So in the past, we have always automated some things, and then our brains have been able to do more complex things. And I want to add a footnote here that also had to do with getting more and more education. Which is something that we have to question going forward. But once these machines clearly surpass our cognitive and intellectual capabilities, it is by no means obvious that we humans would be able to invent or execute new tasks that are not also amenable to the machines.”\n",
            "“Yeah, and so this leads to interesting conclusions if we are to guess around about which jobs could be automated and in which order jobs could be automated. So for example, if we compare something like being a professor of mathematics to being a dance instructor, Moravec's paradox would inform us that perhaps being a professor of mathematics would be automatable before you could automate the job of being a dance instructor.”\n",
            "“So let's say if the machine can cut and sew shirts at a cost of $10, and it takes you three hours to cut and sew a shirt, then you would earn only $10 every three hours. And essentially, if you compete with the machine, the competitive market would say you should have the same earnings for the same product. Now, if the machine gets twice as efficient every two years, which would be in line with Moore's Law, then it means two years later you'll get only $5 for the same shirt, and then $2.50, and so that's where you see that the problem may arise. So right now, there are lots of tasks that machines could in principle perform, but they are just too expensive to be cost competitive, and that's why they are done by humans.”\n",
            "“I can imagine a future where AI performs a lot of the tasks that human doctors perform equally well or better, but some humans are still going to say, well, but I want to see the human doctor. There's going to be probably some sorting by age. I think it's plausible that older folks are likely to stick with human providers much longer in examples like that. Ultimately, if the AI just becomes really significantly better, more and more humans are going to say, well, but ultimately this is medicine. My life is on the line and I'll just go with the best system available.”\n",

            "I find it interesting how people I interact with have very different attitudes toward unemployment and job search. Some people are very confident that if they lost their job, got fired, or just wanted to switch, they would easily find something new. I have personally never felt that way. When my job situation was uncertain, I felt very insecure and somewhat stressed about it on a regular basis. When my situation was more secure, I wondered how long it would last like that. And currently, as I’m very happy with my work I feel so grateful for being able to just focus on my work and not having to worry about another application and interview. \n",
            "Based on my previous research for the World Economic Forum, I get the sense that unemployment and the fear of losing one’s job have a major impact on people’s wellbeing generally. Perhaps these confident people I see and interact with are just really elite and their labor is always in such a strong demand. From our report: “The biggest hit to well-being comes at the moment of becoming unemployed, despite an expectation of some adaptation to the circumstance (though this adaptation to unemployment does not occur fully even after several years). In turn, several studies show that the fear of job automation alone can cause some loss of life satisfaction even before actual unemployment occurs.” \n",
            "I recently revisited some of my Excel sheets where I tracked my job applications to see how much failure or success I achieved during job hunting. The table looks quite red with most applications not leading anywhere out of the 1st round. Initially it was almost all red, over time I tended to get more yellows (meaning I got through the 1st round to interviews or trial work). Overall, I ended up with 17% of my applications ending with offers, 41% of interviews ending with offers, and 35% of applications leading to interviews. Earlier in my career, these numbers would have been much lower, and some of the later success skewing the numbers quite a bit. If not counting short-term projects, then the success numbers are also lower. \n",

            "Back in Europe after a week in California. I had a great time speaking on a panel on AI governance at the 8th Annual Center for Human-Compatible AI Workshop in Asilomar. Some of the points I tried to make in the conversation, mostly to an American audience: \n",
            "ChatGPT didn’t completely derail the EU AI Act with a new focus on general-purpose AI. Already in 2021 November, the Council of the EU introduced an article titled General-Purpose AI Systems. Their proposal was much more limited though saying that “the placing on the market, putting into service or use of general purpose Al stems shall not, by themselves only, make those systems subject to the provisions of this Regulation.” Only putting the system into specific high-risk use would have triggered the regulation. In May 2022, the Council introduced more serious obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI, essentially applying the whole high-risk requirements on these systems. This is all to say that already more than one year before ChatGPT was released there had been a lot of discussion in the EU on how to regulate such systems.  \n",
            "I also made the point that compared to the UK and US AI Safety Institutes, the EU AI Office is a regulator not merely a research institution. The AI Office, after consulting the Board, may conduct evaluations of the general-purpose AI model concerned to assess compliance (if information is insufficient), to investigate systemic risks especially after a qualified alert by the scientific panel, and may decide to appoint independent experts to carry out evaluations on its behalf, including from the scientific panel. The Commission may request access to the general-purpose AI model concerned through APIs or further appropriate technical means and tools. This is quite relevant considering some recent reporting that voluntary commitments about model access by AI corporations are potentially not followed through/respected.  \n",
            "Finally, it came up during the discussion how difficult it is to conduct model evaluations, how the science is not mature enough, and how this might imply avoiding setting up costly mitigations. I think the EU AI Act’s approach here is promising with the AI Office facilitating the drawing up of codes of practice for general-purpose AI and providers together with independent experts from civil society, academia, and elsewhere drafting these and updating them regularly. If new things are learned in how to perform model evaluations, then these can ideally be swiftly included in the codes with each iteration. The AI Office is hiring and plans to be hiring more, so people who want to advance this area, are encouraged to get involved. \n",

As a co-founder and chief scientist, he played a key role in advancing these technologies, earning him the title of the Real Father of OpenAI.\n",

Sutskever’s upbringing profoundly influenced his idealism. He was born in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, moved to Israel with his family as a child, and eventually settled in Canada. His parents, from a middle-class background, were not prominent figures in AI but played a significant role in his education and support.\n",

In this darkness, Danko sacrifices himself by tearing out his heart to light a lamp, guiding everyone out of the forest at the cost of his life.\n",

Although it is unknown if Sutskever read this story in his childhood, Danko’s ultimate sacrifice contrasts with Sutskever, who realizes his ideals through wisdom and technological contributions without sacrificing his life. Danko’s belief was to lead his people to light, while Sutskever’s belief is to advance AI technology for the benefit of all humanity. Both share a common ideal.\n",

In contrast, Sam Altman is pragmatic and business-minded, focusing on rapidly advancing technology, capturing market share, and driving company growth and profitability through practical applications. His goal is to make OpenAI a global leader in artificial intelligence.\n",
            "In the early stages of their collaboration, their strengths complemented each other, driving OpenAI’s development. Sutskever’s technical and research abilities combined with Altman’s business strategy and market expansion led to significant progress for OpenAI in a short time. However, as the company grew and external pressures increased, cracks began to appear in their relationship.\n",

            "In my personal opinion, at that time, ChatGPT had reached the fourth generation. It was capable of directly accessing the internet (although this feature of ChatGPT 4 was later discontinued). Sutskever, as the lead developer, should have been the first to understand that OpenAI had truly achieved the emergence of AI. Although it was a newborn AI and made mistakes in many areas, the potential risks of AI also became apparent. Sutskever might have even thought about the next ten years; even though AI currently lacks the ability to think for itself, once it does, AI will be fundamentally different from humans. Once it makes a decision on an event, that decision could be irreversible. This is the concern of all humanity because, in this respect, AI is different from humans.\n",
            "Ilya Sutskever’s exit is undoubtedly a significant change for OpenAI. As a key founder and scientist, his contributions to OpenAI’s development and the success of the GPT model were immense. His departure marks the end of an era but may also signal a new beginning.\n",
            "From a positive perspective, Sutskever’s exit could bring new opportunities and challenges, especially as he embarks on a new, personally meaningful project.

Instead, it could be an opportunity for reinvention and progress, bringing new prospects for both Sutskever and OpenAI.\n",

            "The discussion around our friends at OpenAI is generating some big waves, and I was asked whether by my previous post on LinkedIn I was taking a position. Here are my personal thoughts on the matter:\n",
            "A) I respect Sam Altman since I met him the first time when he was running YC. I liked his passion to enable founders to be better versions of themselves, but in particular I liked what he did in the last handful years for all of us working in AI for decades - namely educating the world of what AI can do for the world. From small startups to large multinational enterprises, we are all benefitting from his work today. In essence he gave AI visibility even outside the tech community, breaking down barriers. Obviously, he did not work on the AI coding and development himself, but had great partners to work with, like Ilya and Mira.\n",
            "B) I respect Ilya Sutskever for his smartness and his drive to being science oriented when building anything for the world in AI. In the meetings I had with him in 2018 I did like the spirit he has to remind of caution and precision. And of course, his work in science is highly respectable and speaks for itself, as can be measured in Google Scholar: he is one of the 5 most cited authors in the research category \"machine learning\", and the youngest of these top 5.\n",
            "C) I am not privy to what the details are that triggered the event on Friday, but I am sure we all will be informed about them. From what I understand, it might be the (typical) pull and push between one side that wants to push the boundaries from the business perspective, and the other side that wants to make sure that the safety of the users is kept and technology offered is reliable, with full transparency to all parties. It is clear that some of these topic(s?) will need alignment in OpenAI's leadership, but I am sure the leadership and the surrounding entities, advisors, investors and partners are going to make this work.\n",
            "D) the post I shared in my previous post was merely an answer to customers that asked me whether and how they can continue runnung their own respective solutions on aiXplain if they needed to stop using a specific model in their pipelines if they are unsure about the trust in their underlying services (LLMs being model-as-a-service). We believe that every pipeline owner should be able to use the one or the other underlying AI model, regardless what their motivation is, and our olatform allows a swift configuration change.\n",
            "E) OpenAI is a great company that built and continues to build state-of-the-art foundation models, served by OpenAI themselves and by Microsoft Azure, you have these options to pick from in aiXplain, plus many other models, including aiXplain-natively hosted open source LLMs of your choice, or a model you derived (e.g. by using aiXplain's FineTune). Our Bel Esprit, your AI agent on aiXplain, can help you make better decisions on what to use, build with, derive from, and/or test in your pipeline and solution. In realtime.\n",
